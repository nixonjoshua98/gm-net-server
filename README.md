# gm-net-core-api (Greedy Mercs .NET Core API)

.NET API written for a game I was working on titled Greedy Mercs (GM) - API was originally written in [Python](https://github.com/nixonjoshua98/fastapi-server) (Flask then later moved to FastAPI)

It has went through several design iterations, so the design may be 'wonky' in places
